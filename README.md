# KitCleanerPlugin
This is a Paper plugin that resets the usage times of all kits by all players within CMI using its API. 

I developed this program because, while attempting to remove data using SQL, I discovered that the plugin was caching the data in another location. When a kit is claimed, the plugin promptly restores the cached data, making database manipulation ineffective. Therefore, I created this simple program.
